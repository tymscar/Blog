Every single day, I use it to sign my Git commits, authenticate into countless websites, and secure my most important accounts. It&amp;rsquo;s become such an integral part of my workflow that I barely think about it, until it&amp;rsquo;s not there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I made the classic mistake of leaving it in my jeans pocket before throwing them in the washing machine. When I discovered it hours later, soaking wet and seemingly lifeless, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d lost everything. But I managed to save it using a technique I&amp;rsquo;d learned from dealing with other water-damaged electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to fix static noise on macOS headphones</title><link>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/macusbdacstatic/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/macusbdacstatic/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A bit over a year ago, I bought a pair of &lt;a href="https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-nova-pro"&gt;Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro&lt;/a&gt; headphones. They are amazing for what I need—they work great over 2.4 GHz, so I don&amp;rsquo;t experience noticeable latency like with Bluetooth, and I can connect four devices to the base station simultaneously. This is something I do daily when working on multiple computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never had any issues until I connected them to a Mac mini with an M2 processor. After an indeterminate amount of time, static noise started coming out of the headphones, getting progressively louder until they became unusable. Rebooting the headphones didn’t help, nor did changing the output device to something else and back again. If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used them successfully on other devices, I would have assumed they were broken.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
