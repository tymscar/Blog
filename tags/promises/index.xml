It's Still Open.</title><link>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/openaiunmergeddemo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/openaiunmergeddemo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;During OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-5 launch event, they demoed the model&amp;rsquo;s ability to fix real bugs in production code. Live on stage. In their own repository. The kind of demo that makes CTOs reach for their credit cards and engineers nervously update their resumes. There&amp;rsquo;s just one small problem: the fix they promised to merge &amp;ldquo;right after the show&amp;rdquo; is still sitting there, unmerged, three and a half months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-demo"&gt;The Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At exactly 1 hour and 7 minutes into their launch video, they started working on issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/2472"&gt;#2472&lt;/a&gt; in their openai-python repository.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
