After all, &lt;a href="https://www.tymscar.com/assets/images/visualisations/ezgif.com-gif-maker285292.gif"&gt;my profile picture&lt;/a&gt;, almost everywhere, is a LiDAR scan of my head that I accomplished with the FaceID of an old iPhone about five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I stumbled upon &lt;a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/3d_gaussian_splatting_high.pdf"&gt;a new paper about something called Gaussian Splatting&lt;/a&gt;. This topic is fascinating because, instead of creating a 3D mesh, it more closely resembles a point cloud that is expanded and shaped in such a way that it looks highly realistic. One usecase that interests me in particular is bringing these in as VR backdrops.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
