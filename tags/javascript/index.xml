&lt;p&gt;For the last seven years, including this one, I have managed to get all the stars. I do not say that to brag. I say it because it explains why I keep coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one of the few tech traditions I never get bored of, even after doing it for a long time. I like the time pressure. I like the community vibe. I like that every December I can pick one language and go all in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using Nix to build JS/TS projects with private dependencies</title><link>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/nixprivatenpmrepos/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:50:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/nixprivatenpmrepos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.tymscar.com/nix-private-npm-repos/githubActioonsSuccess.png" alt="“Running code from a private repo”)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nix is a great tool for building software, especially in professional settings because of the guarantees it comes with.&lt;br&gt;
For example, you can be sure that the software you build is reproducible and that it will work on any machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building packages in the Nix world, you usually end up going with derivation builders already made for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Rust there is &lt;code&gt;rustPlatform.buildRustPackage&lt;/code&gt;, for Go there is &lt;code&gt;go2nix&lt;/code&gt;, for JS/TS there is &lt;code&gt;node2nix&lt;/code&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simulating soapy water</title><link>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/soapsim/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/soapsim/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever just scroll mindlessly online and stumble upon a satisfying video about physics and you can&amp;rsquo;t help but have that urge to reproduce it in code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, just me? Well perhaps this blogpost isn&amp;rsquo;t for you then. Otherwise, buckle up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment that caught my eye this time around was this video of a plate of water, with some pepper sprinkled on top uniformly, that when touched with a soapy finger, makes the pepper repel.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
