It's Still Open.</title><link>/posts/openaiunmergeddemo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/openaiunmergeddemo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;During OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-5 launch event, they demoed the model&amp;rsquo;s ability to fix real bugs in production code. Live on stage. In their own repository. The kind of demo that makes CTOs reach for their credit cards and engineers nervously update their resumes. There&amp;rsquo;s just one small problem: the fix they promised to merge &amp;ldquo;right after the show&amp;rdquo; is still sitting there, unmerged, three and a half months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-demo"&gt;The Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At exactly 1 hour and 7 minutes into their launch video, they started working on issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/2472"&gt;#2472&lt;/a&gt; in their openai-python repository.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When Curl Works But IntelliJ Doesn’t: The Ollama Connection Mystery</title><link>/posts/intellijollamaconnectionmystery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/intellijollamaconnectionmystery/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I run a bunch of internal services through Traefik on my LAN, each with a proper domain name and TLS, so I don’t have to remember ports. One of them is Ollama, sitting on a beefy gaming PC at &lt;code&gt;10.0.0.105&lt;/code&gt; and exposed as &lt;code&gt;https://ollama.tymscar.com&lt;/code&gt;. From the terminal everything behaved exactly as expected: fast responses, certificate valid, models listed. Then IntelliJ IDEA decided this host basically didn’t exist. The “Test Connection” button just said “Failed to connect”. No detail. No hint. Just a smug little red failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Running OpenAI's GPT-OSS locally: the good, the bad, and the loopy</title><link>/posts/gptoss/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 20:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/gptoss/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;OpenAI recently launched something I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to see from them: an open source model called &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/"&gt;GPT-OSS&lt;/a&gt;. After years of keeping their models locked behind APIs, they&amp;rsquo;ve finally released both 20 billion and 120 billion parameter models that you can run entirely on your own hardware. Both can run on consumer grade hardware, but realistically most people would go with the 20 billion model since it fully fits into 16 gigs of VRAM on a GPU, which is why I went with that one as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using Nix to build JS/TS projects with private dependencies</title><link>/posts/nixprivatenpmrepos/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:50:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/nixprivatenpmrepos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/nix-private-npm-repos/githubActioonsSuccess.png" alt="“Running code from a private repo”)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nix is a great tool for building software, especially in professional settings because of the guarantees it comes with.&lt;br&gt;
For example, you can be sure that the software you build is reproducible and that it will work on any machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to building packages in the Nix world, you usually end up going with derivation builders already made for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Rust there is &lt;code&gt;rustPlatform.buildRustPackage&lt;/code&gt;, for Go there is &lt;code&gt;go2nix&lt;/code&gt;, for JS/TS there is &lt;code&gt;node2nix&lt;/code&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I wrote my Vision Pro killer app (Script Anchor)</title><link>/posts/scriptanchor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/scriptanchor/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="ive-always-like-vr"&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always like VR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 15 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been captivated by the possibilities of VR/AR. It all became real when I held my first Google Cardboard at Google I/O 2015—here&amp;rsquo;s the moment captured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/script-anchor/google-cardboard.jpg" alt="My Google Cardboard"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My professional and personal life has been deeply intertwined with virtual reality. I spent five fulfilling years harnessing VR&amp;rsquo;s potential at JLR, and for my Bachelor of Science First Class Honours degree at BCU, I pioneered an augmented reality project that allowed users to overlay virtual attractions onto the real world. Even outside of work, I&amp;rsquo;ve remained an avid VR enthusiast, frequently engaging with the best headsets out there, from the industry-celebrated Microsoft Hololens to the impressive capabilities of the less known Pimax 8K.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simulating soapy water</title><link>/posts/soapsim/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/soapsim/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you ever just scroll mindlessly online and stumble upon a satisfying video about physics and you can&amp;rsquo;t help but have that urge to reproduce it in code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, just me? Well perhaps this blogpost isn&amp;rsquo;t for you then. Otherwise, buckle up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment that caught my eye this time around was this video of a plate of water, with some pepper sprinkled on top uniformly, that when touched with a soapy finger, makes the pepper repel.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to fix WSL2 crashing mid compile (Or any heavy IO)</title><link>/posts/wsloom/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/wsloom/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Reminiscing with some friends about how long the compile times were on Gentoo back in the day when we used it, I got curious about how long it would take to compile Chromium today in WSL2 on an &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230497/intel-core-i913900kf-processor-36m-cache-up-to-5-80-ghz/specifications.html"&gt;i9 13900KF CPU&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;All you have to do to compile Chromium is follow the official Google build instructions &lt;a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/&amp;#43;/main/docs/linux/build_instructions.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Critical Alert - Tech Industry Must Act on Job Market Chaos!</title><link>/posts/jobhunting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 12:31:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/jobhunting/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="applying-to-a-job-is-a-broken-system"&gt;Applying to a job is a broken system&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is a call to action, urging reform in the tech recruitment process. It&amp;rsquo;s a shared struggle, demanding change for a more efficient and promising future in our industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the tech recruiting scene, a significant emphasis is placed on writing personalized cover letters. However, these letters, requiring genuine and thoughtful effort, are time-intensive to compose, sometimes demanding as much time as a full-time job, just for a chance at being noticed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How I deploy private GitHub projects to local self-hosted servers (CI/CD)</title><link>/posts/privategithubcicd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 18:04:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/privategithubcicd/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="how-i-deploy-private-github-projects-to-local-self-hosted-servers-cicd"&gt;How I deploy private GitHub projects to local self-hosted servers (CI/CD)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of experience with massive CI/CD pipelines that deploy private code to public servers. I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked with pipelines that deploy public repositories to private servers, such as my homelab. However, I never experimented with a pipeline that takes a private GitHub repo, builds it, and deploys it to a server on the LAN. That&amp;rsquo;s precisely what I needed for a project I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on that isn&amp;rsquo;t yet public.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Running Jetbrains remote dev servers on NixOS</title><link>/posts/jetbrainsremotedevservernixos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 00:33:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/jetbrainsremotedevservernixos/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/jb-nix-remote-server/project.png" alt="A remote project"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I have raised &lt;a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/243533"&gt;a PR to fix this&lt;/a&gt; upstream and got it merged, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to follow the guide anymore, you can just use the package on nixpkgs unstable for the time being and later on in the future, a stable branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year or so I have been very interested in &lt;a href="https://nixos.org/"&gt;NixOS and Nix&lt;/a&gt; in general.
I have set it up as my &lt;a href="https://github.com/tymscar/dotfiles"&gt;main OS on my desktop&lt;/a&gt;, I have used it on remote VPS instances, and I have used it for local projects as well in the shape of nix environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
