Honestly? I don&amp;rsquo;t really care that much. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actively browsed the site in years. But it used to be everywhere. Back when Reddit embedded everything on Imgur, maybe fifteen years ago, it was genuinely useful. Then Reddit built their own image hosting, Discord did the same, and Imgur slowly faded into the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it never fully disappeared. And since the block, I keep stumbling across Imgur links that just show &amp;ldquo;unavailable.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s mildly infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
