I have two buckets: one for important files like documents, and one for homelab services. The services bucket backs up things like qcow2 disk images for my VMs, some of which are hundreds of gigabytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I created the buckets, I set the &lt;a href="https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-lifecycle-rules"&gt;lifecycle rule&lt;/a&gt; to &amp;ldquo;Keep only the last version of the file.&amp;rdquo; I assumed this meant Backblaze would automatically replace old versions when new ones arrived. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Imgur Geo-Blocked the UK, So I Geo-Unblocked My Entire Network</title><link>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/imgurukproxy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.tymscar.com/posts/imgurukproxy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Imgur decided to block UK users. Honestly? I don&amp;rsquo;t really care that much. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actively browsed the site in years. But it used to be everywhere. Back when Reddit embedded everything on Imgur, maybe fifteen years ago, it was genuinely useful. Then Reddit built their own image hosting, Discord did the same, and Imgur slowly faded into the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it never fully disappeared. And since the block, I keep stumbling across Imgur links that just show &amp;ldquo;unavailable.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s mildly infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
